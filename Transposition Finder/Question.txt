#Coding test
 
2 keys on a calculator (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, +, -, /, *) have been switched resulting in the following incorrect arithmetic expressions. The outputs (on the right of the ‘=‘) are correct but the inputs (on the left of the ‘=‘) are incorrect.
Everything to the right of the = is correct but there maybe a mistake on the left side

123 = 3 # for example could be 1*3=3
8423 = 252
4+4 = 8
4*7-10 = 417
9/3 = 3
42-9 = -36
 
We need to write some code to identify which 2 keys have been switched.
 
Please complete using Python, Java or Ruby and send back your code and the keys that have been switched.
